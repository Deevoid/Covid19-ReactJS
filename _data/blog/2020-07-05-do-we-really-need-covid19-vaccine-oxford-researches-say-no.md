**Do we really need a vaccine for Coronavirus.**

While the race for the first Covid19 vaccine is on the full moon, Researches now suggest that we might not need the vaccine for the Coronavirus.

Professor Sunetra Gupta, a researcher based out of Oxford University feels that while a lot of studies are being done on vaccine efficacy, the COVID-19 might be just another pandemic like the flu, and we might not need anything special for the same.

Speaking to a media house, the professor said that COVID-19 only poses an extreme danger for those belonging to high-risk categories, and those who are healthy can recover quickly.

“What we’ve seen is that in normal, healthy people, who are not elderly or frail, this virus is not something to worry about no more than how we worry about flu,”

> Dr Sunetra's statement might be in accordance with what the WHO said a month back.

Even as WHO has taken into account the speedy developments happening on the global front, an official from the health body once said that a ready vaccine for public deployment might take up to 4-5 years to happen and it would be wrong for the world to pin hopes on a vaccine alone. Other measures need to be put in place too.
